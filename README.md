# Paper C – Functional Response / Consumption Model (TMB + R + MATLAB)

This repository contains the full codebase for **Paper C** of my PhD thesis, where we 
develop a functional response model for cod consumption based on empirical capelin data.  
The implementation combines **TMB (C++)**, **R**, and optional **MATLAB** routines 
for additional figure generation.

The repository is organised to ensure full reproducibility of the analyses and figures 
in the paper.
